Afrin buys mangoes from market and sell it directly on the street. Afrin sold mangoes for the same price to the customer on Monday and Tuesday. But the cost afrin pays to buy the mangoes on Monday is 10% less in the market.
If the profit was 60% on Monday. What was the percentage of profit on Tuesday?
