Afrin was a business minded person. She buys 3 varieties of candies everyday and sells in her school during lunch time to make pocket money.

On monday, she bought 36 strawberry candies, 42 mango candies, and 54 orange candies.

One of her friend got his birthday on tuesday. He has 16 friends. He asked Afrin that he want to give 7 candies to each of his friends.
