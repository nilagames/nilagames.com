Singalion and Nishanth are playing a game using coordinates (x, y).

Nishanth moves 3 times,

(3, 4) to (4, 4)
(4, 4) to (4, 6)
(4, 6) to (6, 5)

How many steps travelled by Nishanth in these three moves?

A step is moving to adjacent coordinate.
For examples,
(3, 2) to (3, 3) is 1 step towards top.
(3, 2) to (0, 2) is 3 step towards left.
