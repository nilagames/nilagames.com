Nila went to swimming pool on Monday. Each batch contains 6 people. A batch can swim at the same time. Each batch can swim for 10 mins and then automatic cleaning happens for 2 mins. Then the next batch swims and this cycle continues. Nila is on the 34th position in the queue.

At what time, she get's the chance to swim?
