Nikita visits Dr. Mathews for Diabetes on 12th June 2020. Doctor suggested her to take pills every alternate day starting from that day. But Nikita forget everything easily. She was pretty sure, she wonâ€™t be able to remember the last day she took the medicine. And then she would end up taking the medicines on wrong days.
